## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### ⚠️ DO NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities

Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security contact email]
2. **Subject**: Use "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"
3. **Include**:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### 📞 Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users:

1. **Secure Credentials**: Keep your `config.json` file secure
2. **Trust Management**: Regularly review trusted devices with `/trusted`
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check `bot.log` for suspicious activity
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep the bot updated to the latest version
5. **Network Security**: Run the bot on secure networks only

### For Developers:

1. **Code Review**: All security-related changes require review
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
3. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive data in error messages
4. **Logging**: Log security events but not sensitive data
5. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and secure

## 🛠️ Security Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] API credentials are properly secured
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] All inputs are validated
- [ ] Error messages don't leak information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Code has been reviewed for security issues

## 📋 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations:

1. **Local Storage**: Config files are stored in plain text locally
2. **Session Files**: Telegram session files contain authentication data
3. **Log Files**: May contain IP addresses and device information

### Mitigation:

1. **File Permissions**: Set appropriate file permissions (600)
2. **Gitignore**: Sensitive files are excluded from version control
3. **Documentation**: Clear warnings about sensitive file handling

## 🔍 Security Audit

The project undergoes regular security reviews:

- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis of security-sensitive code
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates for vulnerable dependencies
- **Manual Review**: Human review of security-critical components

## 📞 Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **GitHub Issues**: For general security discussions (non-sensitive)
